Loderunner Cycle 3 report and Cycle 4 plans:

Team #19          Members:Nithin Perumal, Karan Shishoo, Timothy Smith		


CYCLE 3 REPORT:

Which user stories did your team successfully implement and test?
Guards appear on the screen and move around.
User presses the left or right arrow keys. The hero begins to move to the left or right respectively.
Hero encounters a ladder. If user presses the up or down arrow keys at this time, the hero moves up or down the ladder.
Ladders and Falling should also be functional - mostly
Hero or guard encounters a rope. Keeps moving by hanging on the rope.
User presses the U key. The game goes to the next level.



Which stories were in your plans, but did not get done?  Describe the state of each.
We were unable to get the hero and guards to pick up gold blocks but we are in the process of getting this part
done with.



What research experiments did your team do as you learn about technologies?
We learned about using the keylisteners as well as where to place them to avoid impeding the functionality of a
program.  We also learned more about implementing threads in our program.



Briefly describe the main contributions of each team member during Cycle 3.
Nithin -> Implemented the guard class to have it appear and use random movement (for now).  Also helped in
setting up and improving the other classes to increase their compatibility with the game's requirements

Tim -> Implemented the hero class in almost its entirety (apart from block breaking and gold collection)

Karan -> Worked on creating some new levels as well as refreshing the screen to improve movement of the character.
Also made the map read off of a text document accurately.




CYCLE 4 PLANS:


USER STORIES:

List the user stories that you plan to implement in Cycle 4:
Hero finds gold. The gold disappears and the visible score increases. If the last gold an exit ladder is placed. 
Bricks are in front of the hero. The user presses X and digs through them.
Bricks are below the hero. The user presses Z and digs the bricks block in front of him.
Bricks after a period of time after being broken reappear killing anything in their spot.
Hero runs into a guard. Hero dies and level restarts.
Guard encounters gold. The gold is removed from the map until the guard dies.
A guard dies. A new one replaces him spawning from the top of the screen.
User presses the D key. The game goes to the previous level.
User can load a previous save game file



RESEARCH:   
What information/techniques does your team need to research, and who is assigned to investigate what?
We will need to work on destroying guard objects and creating new ones as well as fixing the glitches that
exist in the game currently.  We will also try to implement a save/load ablity to our game along with some other
extras.

Nithin -> Will work on using key presses to destroy the bricks as well as fixing some of the pre-existing glitches
that are all over the game.

Karan -> Will work on making the buttons to increase / decrease levels less glitchy as well as work on making
the guards chase after the hero character.  Will also work on letting the guards collect gold.

Tim -> Will work further on the hero to make him capable of collecting gold and perform other actions that have
not yet been able.






MISC:
Describe any other aspects of your plans for cycle 4.

We will attempt to add some other extras to the game if time permits.  We hope to be able to create a save/load
interface for our game as well as possibly use images rather than boxes for our heroes and guards.
